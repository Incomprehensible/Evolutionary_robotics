# Evolutionary_robotics

ROS2 framework written in C++ for applying genetic algorithm to enable mobile robot controllers evolution.
It utilizes the abstractions and polymorphism provided by C++ for extendability to different algorithms, controller types and use-cases. 
However, the implementation is not finalized yet, and user needs to manually specify the classes/interfaces in some cases.

## How to build

## How to run

This code is part of my Mobile Robot Programming experiments and shouldn't be used in real-world hardware applications.
